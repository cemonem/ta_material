function [solns] = ik_2link_arm(d, x, y)
%IK_2LINK_ARM calculate IK for 2-link arm
%   returns a 2xn matrix solns containing joint variables, with each row
%   being [theta_1 theta_2] (defined visually in the hw text) for the
%   global position (x, y) of the end effector.
%   If there is no solution, solns is an empty array.
%   d is the length of a single link.
